emacs-genesis-mode
==================

Emacs major mode for editing GENESIS neuron simulator script files.

Modified from: wpdl-mode-el and from DerivedMode example in Emacs Wiki.

Installation:
--------------

 Load `genesis-mode.el` in (X)Emacs. In *Emacs*, placing it under `~/.emacs.d/` should suffice.
 If it is not autoloaded when Emacs starts, place the following lines in
 your `~/.emacs` file:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
(require 'genesis-mode)
```

 In *XEmacs*, place `genesis-mode.el` under `~/.xemacs/` and add the following in your `~/.xemacs/init.el` file:

```lisp
(load-file "~/.xemacs/genesis-mode.el")
```

Functionality:
------

This mode provides:

* syntax highlighting for Genesis keywords, functions, and objects. 
* automatic indentation with the tab key
* function index menu item

It is based on original Xemacs major mode by HC and an example used in
a tutorial about Emacs mode creation. The tutorial can be found here:
http://renormalist.net/Renormalist/EmacsLanguageModeCreationTutorial

TODO
----------

* Fix `function-menu` in Xemacs

* Unify syntax highlighting for both Emacses
* Indentation: 'end' on line after continuation ends are ignored
* Indentation: Sometimes takes previous line's wrong indentation even if it's only whitespace
